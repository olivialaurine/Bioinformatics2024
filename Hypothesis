We propose that the Duchenne muscular dystrophy disease phenotype is caused by a mutation in DMD (dystrophin) gene. This mutation results in improperly expressed RNA and vital proteins being absent in those affected by the disease. The absence of this vital protein results in the symptoms of muscular dystrophy displayed by those with the misexpressed DMD gene.
